===================================
          Requirements
===================================

1. Software and Tools
-----------------------------------
- Python 3.x (recommended: Python 3.8 or higher)
- Code Editor or IDE:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - PyCharm
  - Sublime Text
- Terminal or Command Line Interface (for running the game)



2. Python Libraries
-----------------------------------
- No external libraries required.
- Built entirely with Python's standard library (e.g., math, input, print).



3. File Structure
-----------------------------------
The project directory should include the following files:

  /project-folder
  ├── main.py        # Entry point of the game
  ├── game.py        # Game logic: board display, player/AI moves
  ├── ai.py          # AI logic: Minimax, Alpha-Beta, Heuristic



4. Knowledge Requirements
-----------------------------------
To understand and modify the project, familiarity with the following is helpful:

- Python Basics:
  - Lists and indexing
  - Functions and recursion
  - Input/output handling

- Game Development Concepts:
  - Turn-based logic
  - Win/draw conditions
  - Grid representation using lists

- Algorithms and AI:
  - Minimax Algorithm (recursive game tree search)
  - Alpha-Beta Pruning (search optimization)
  - Heuristic Evaluation (scoring board states)
  - Recursive function calls and backtracking



5. System Requirements
-----------------------------------
- Any operating system with Python support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- No additional installations or heavy resource usage
